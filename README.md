# aleph-carpet
A carpet extension made for AlephSMP in Minecraft 1.16

This is a fork of FractalCarpetAddon. When Aleph changed from 1.15 to 1.16 it also underwent a name change from FractalSMP. This was the perfect opportunity to justify a repository move to the organization page to go along with the version update and name change.
